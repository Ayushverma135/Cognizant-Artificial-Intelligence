# Cognizant Artificial Intelligence Job Simulation - September 2023

## Overview
The Cognizant Artificial Intelligence Job Simulation was a practical exercise designed to provide participants with hands-on experience in data analysis and machine learning. The simulation aimed to mimic real-world tasks that might be encountered as part of Cognizant’s Data Science team. The focus was on applying analytical skills to derive insights from data and presenting those insights in a business context.

## Project Summary
The project involved working with a dataset provided by one of Cognizant’s technology-led clients, Gala Groceries. The task was to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), build a machine learning model, and communicate the findings effectively.

## Key Responsibilities and Deliverables

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Utilized Python and Google Colab to explore and analyze the provided dataset.
   - Conducted data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to identify key trends and patterns.
   - Analyzed features and relationships within the data, identifying any anomalies or outliers that might affect the model's performance.

2. **Machine Learning Model Development**  
   - Developed a Python module that encapsulated the entire machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
   - Selected appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the data characteristics and project requirements.
   - Trained the model and evaluated its performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

3. **Performance Metrics and Evaluation**  
   - Assessed the model's performance through rigorous testing and validation.
   - Documented the performance metrics, including a detailed explanation of the chosen metrics and their significance in the context of the project.

4. **Communication of Findings**  
   - Created a PowerPoint presentation to summarize the findings and insights derived from the analysis.
   - The presentation included visualizations, key metrics, and actionable insights that could inform business decisions for Gala Groceries.
   - Emphasized the business implications of the data insights and suggested potential next steps for leveraging the model in a real-world scenario.
